You don't want to compromise bake time by introducing a wet ingredient (like in these <a href=\"https://joyfoodsunshine.com/peanut-butter-crusted-sweet-potato-fries/\">peanut butter sweet potato fries</a>) before it's time.<br/><strong>Flip and stir during baking.\u00a0</strong>In order to ensure that all sides of your roasted sweet potatoes are browned, it's crucial that you stir/flip them during roasting. Sometimes I even use tongs to individually flip sweet potato cubes to ensure I didn't miss any!<br/><strong>Cut the sweet potatoes in small, thin pieces.</strong> The more surface area of the baked sweet potato cubes that are exposed to the surface of the baking sheet, the higher the ratio of browned, crispy outside to soft inside will be. Plus, smaller pieces decreases baking time!",
